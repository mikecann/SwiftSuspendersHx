This is my initial attempt at a port of SwiftSuspenders 2 over to Haxe, im slowly working through getting each test case to pass in flash. Its fairly laborious work so if you would like to help out I would be extremely greateful!

See Till Schneidereit's awesome orignal AS3 version for more info on the library that this port is based on: https://github.com/tschneidereit/SwiftSuspenders
